## Preparing the operating system
The node runs headless, that means without keyboard or display, so the operating system Raspbian Stretch Lite is used. 

1. Download the [Raspbian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) disk image
2. Write the disk image to your SD card with [this guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md)

### Enable Secure Shell
Without keyboard or screen, no direct interaction with the Pi is possible during the initial setup. After writing the image to the Micro SD card, create an empty file called “ssh” (without extension) in the main directory of the card. This causes the Secure Shell (ssh) to be enabled from the start and we will be able to login remotely. 

* Create a file `ssh` in the boot partition of the MicroSD card

### Prepare Wifi 
I would not recommend it, but you can run your RaspiBolt with a wireless network connection. To avoid using a network cable for the initial setup, you can pre-configure the wireless settings:

* Create a file `wpa_supplicant.conf` on the MicroSD card with the following content. Note that the network name (ssid) and password need to be in double-quotes (like `psk="password"`)  
```
country=[COUNTRY_CODE]
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
    ssid="[WIFI_SSID]"
    psk="[WIFI_PASSWORD]"
}
```
* Replace `[COUNTRY_CODE]` with the [ISO2 code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search) of your country (eg. `US`)
* Replace `[WIFI_SSID]` and `[WIFI_PASSWORD]` with the credentials for your own WiFi.


### Start your Pi
* Safely eject the sd card from your computer
* Insert the sd card into the Pi
